Research:
    ☐ Socket.io Middleware

Questions:
    - Laravel like route registrations or with class config ?

Libs:
    io-router: 
        - : https://github.com/tdzienniak/io-router/
        - Uses nested objects for routing
        - Interesting init call with the socket -> https://github.com/tdzienniak/io-router/blob/master/src/index.js
        - Supports rerouting with merged .route object
        - Gets request ( modified socket ) as a route param.

    iosync:
        - : https://github.com/mahdCompany/iosync
        - More of a sync library -> Include functionality in the srocket lib to make sync easy with

    ternion:
        - : https://github.com/michael-kamel/ternion
        - Include validation -> Include validation in the srocket.
        - Supplied data, and response object, express like.

    socketnet:
        - : https://github.com/leon3s/socknet
        - Good docs : http://socknet.io/
        - Uses object based routing -> first arg : config -> route-prefix...
        - Object based routing allows for easy code splitting.
        - Has a lifecycle built-in ( before, on, after hooks )
        - Objects can be registered vie socket.on(eventObject)
        - Built in sessions.
        - Has some sort of Validation via ArgTypes ?
        - Overall a very good library.

    Socket.io-Wildcard:
        - : https://github.com/hden/socketio-wildcard
        - Example of a simple middleware
        - Provieds a Wildcard event that responds to all events.
