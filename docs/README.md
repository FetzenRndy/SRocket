# SRocket
> SRocket ( short for: SocketRocket ) is a batteries-included, opinionated socket.io framework written in typescript.


## Disclaimer

!> SRocket is still under heavy construction! When the framework is released there will be a npm-package, and maybe even a cli, since SRocket is very opinionated.
While reading the documentation keep in mind that the structure and the api may change at every point in time. 
Currently the easiest way to start using the framework is to copy it from source!
